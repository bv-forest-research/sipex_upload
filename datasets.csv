1,Timber-focused Evaluation of Partial Cutting in BC Under the Forest and Range Evaluation Program,"In 2006, the ministry’s Forest and Range Evaluation Program (FREP) initiated a project to develop methods to evaluate in partial-cut areas the degree to which government’s objectives  or timber (as specified in the Forest and Range Practices Act, FRPA) were being met. Methods for both routine and intensive evaluation were developed and then used in a trial evaluation. This report provides the 2006 draft version of the routine and intensive evaluationprocedures and presents the results of their application in partial-cut stands in a management unit in south-eastern BC.",BC Ministry of Forests,"case study, canada, british columbia, wet interior forests, montane and subalpine forests, interior cedar hemlock, engelmann spruce subalpine fir, harvest, reforestation, site preparation, timber, ecosystem health, economic, retention system, planting, brushing, regeneration cut, monitoring, Pl, lodgepole pine, pinus contorta, Fd, douglas fir, pseudotsuga menziesii, Lw, western larch, larix occidentalis, Hw, western hemlock, tsuga heterophylla, Cw, western redcedar, thuja plicata, Pw, western white pine, pinus monticola, low-value timber, site productivity, structure, growth, mountain pine beetle, windthrow, root disease",Open Data Commons Attribution License,"reforestation, variable-retention, monitoring"
2,"Roberts Creek Study Forest: Harvesting, windthrow, and conifer regeneration within alternative silviculture systems","Throughout British Columbia (BC), social, legislative, and stewardship issues are driving forest managers to evaluate alternatives to clearcutting for harvesting and managing forests. The BC Ministry of Forests established the Roberts Creek Study Forest (RCSF) to demonstrate and evaluate different harvest treatments in mature, mixed-conifer forests along the lower slopes of the Sunshine Coast, just north of Vancouver, BC . Selected treatments were designed to meet a variety of biological, social, and economic objectives and had management objectives in common, including: regenerate with Douglas-fir (primary species) and western redcedar (secondary species) for sawlog production, and employ cable yarding systems to minimize soil disturbance",BC Ministry of Forests,"technical report, canada, british columbia, roberts creek, sunshine coast, coastal forests, CWH, harvest, reforestation, intervention, adaptive management, forest health, ecosystem health, variable retention, thinning, pre-commercial thinning, commercial thinning, monitoring, regeneration cut, roberts creek research forest, CWHdm , coastal western hemlock zone_dry_mild, Fd, douglas fir, pseudotsuga menziesii, Hw, western hemlock, tsuga heterophylla, Cw, western redcedar, thuja plicata, area-based, site productivity, windthrow",Open Data Commons Attribution License,"reforestation, variable-retention, thinning, monitoring, stand-interventions"
3,Forest Carbon and Management Options in an Uncertain Climate,"One of the current climate change mitigation strategies is the management of forestedecosystems to ensure that they remain a sink for carbon now and into the future. WithBritish Columbia’s climate expected to continue to warm into the future, our forests willalso change in response. If a choice is made to manage for carbon as one of the manylandscape objectives, forest managers will need to know how best to do so given the likelychanges in natural disturbance regimes that may accompany the changing climate.",BC Ministry of Forests,"extension note, canada, british columbia, sub-boreal forests,, coastal forests, boreal forests, dry interior forests, montane and subalpine forests, wet interior forests, harvest, reforestation, site preperation, intervention, carbon, forest health, climate change resilience, variable retention, planting, thinning, fertilizing, waste management, brushing, site productivity, stand age, size class distribution, natual disturbances",Open Data Commons Attribution License,"reforestation, variable-retention, thinning"
4,Natural regeneration of lodgepole pine following partial harvesting on northern caribou winter range in west-central British Columbia,"This study compares pine natural regeneration density and height growth in small harvested openings (0.01–0.07 ha) within two biogeoclimatic subzones (Sub-Boreal Pine–Spruce xc and Montane Spruce xv) and three partial harvesting treatments on northern caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribouGmelin) winter range in the western Chilcotin region of British Columbia, Canada. Regeneration density was assessed annually for 7 years (1996–2002). In year 7, post-logging ingress stems > 1 year old had a significantly greater density on sbpsxc blocks (5898 stems per hectare) than on the higher-elevation msxv blocks (1829 stems per hectare). The percentage of 2-m2 plots with a natural post-logging seedling > 1 year old averaged 52% in the sbpsxc and 31% in the msxv. Advance regeneration added substantially to density and stocking in the sbpsxc but not in the msxv. These results indicate that small (0.01–0.07 ha) harvested openings in the sbpsxc can be naturally restocked by lodgepole pine without post-logging site preparation, but higher-elevation blocks in the msxv will need to be planted to ensure full stocking by lodgepole pine within 7 years. However, the long period between harvest entries on caribou winter range may still allow sufficient time to naturally regenerate openings in the msxv.",BC Ministry of Forests,"peer-reviewed literature, case study, canada, british columbia, chilcotin western.

5,Southern Interior Forest Region: Forest Health Stand Establishment Decision Aids,"Since 1998, the Early Stand Dynamics program of FORREX–Forest Research Extension Partnership, in collaboration with itsvolunteers and partners, has assessed the information needs of the operational silvicultural community. This process identified anumber of issues relating to management of competing vegetation, forest health, silvicultural systems, and best practices. Besidesinformation needs, members of the silvicultural community also expressed concern about the loss of their experiential knowledge.These operational concerns prompted the initiation of an extension project to fill in identified information gaps and docu-ment local knowledge. Competing vegetation and forest health were selected as the first subject areas on which to focus effort.Information relating to these two subject areas was collected, synthesized, and presented in an easy-to-use format. The resultingproduct was then presented to both the operational and scientific communities for review and input.",BC Ministry of Forests,"decision-aid, canada, british columbia, southern interior bc, montane and subalpine forests, dry interior forests, sub-boreal forests, ESSF, engalmann spruce sub-alpine fir, ICH, interior cedar hemlock, IDF, interior douglas fir, MS

6,"Successional Responses to Natural Disturbance, Forest Management, and Climate Change in British Columbia's Forests","Natural and human-induced disturbance such as wildfire, insect and disease outbreak,windthrow, and forest harvesting are important drivers for forest renewal, post-distur-bance stand structure, and ecosystem function. Each disturbance or combination of dis-turbances sets up a forest to proceed down a certain successional pathway in terms ofstructure and function. Using the context of Ecoprovinces and Ecosystem Types, succes-sional pathways of a variety of ecosystems found in British Columbia are briefly described,and the ways in which forest management practices have affected those pathways are dis-cussed. This Extension Note also describes how projected changes in temperature andprecipitation may also affect these natural disturbance drivers. The information containedin this article is based on a larger synthesis report that is available in FORREX Series 28and is designed to facilitate further conversation around building resistant and resilientforests for the future.

7,"Future Fire Risk and The Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential of Forest Rehabilitation in British Columbia, Canada","Increased forest fires in the future will create opportunities to undertake salvage logging and replanting activities with the potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relative to a ‘do nothing’ scenario that relies on natural regeneration. Salvage logging of fire-killed wood will generate additional useful products for society while replanting will provide opportunities to establish seedlings with genetic gain and increased climate resilience. In British Columbia, Canada, our study showed that cumulative net GHG benefit from these rehabilitation activities on about 14 % of the area burned ranges from –32 to _79 MtCO2e in 2070, but cumulative net GHG reduction benefits are not realized for 23 to 31 years due to the emissions debt that is incurred from harvest wood product emissions and residue management. Scenarios were modelled using the Generic Carbon Budget Model (GCBM) that tracked carbon in the forest and a harvested wood products model that tracked the fate of C and the substitution benefits achieved through wood use, both developed by the Canadian Forest Service. Results were evaluated across 100 simulations of future fire, developed using a log-normal model fit to historic fire events and an assumption of linearly increased area annually burned by 2070 to double the average of the period 1950 to 2018. Our results suggest that mitigation efforts might be better directed at reducing wildfire risks and emissions in the first place, rather than rehabilitating post-fire outcomes.",BC Ministry of Forests,"peer-reviewed literature, canada, british columbia, south interior bc, north interior, dry interior forests, wet interior forests, montane and subalpine forests, IDF, interior douglas fir, ICH, interior cedar hemlock, BWBS, boreal white and black spruce, SBS, sub-boreal spruce, SBPS, sub-boreal pine spruce, restoration, fuel management, harvest, wildfire risk, carbon, climate change resilience, timber, salvage, models, restoration, fuel management, planting, biomass product, Fd, douglas fir, pseudotsuga menziesii, Pl, lodgepole pine, pinus contorta, Sw, white spruce, picea glauca, Cw, western redcedar , thuja plicata, Se, engelmann spruce, picea engelmannii, pulp, natural disturbances, growth, fire, drought",Open Data Commons Attribution License,"fuel-management, restoration"
8,Maintaining attributes of old-growth forests in coastal B.C. through variable retention,"Variable retention is a new approach to harvesting and silvicultural systems that was developed by ecologists in the Pacific Northwest region of North America to address a wide array of forest management goals. Variable retention recognizes that natural disturbances, such as fire, wind or disease, nearly always leave some standing structure from the original forest. This structural complexity plays an important role in forest ecosystem function and biological diversity. A new “retention silvicultural system” was defined that leaves trees distributed throughout harvested areas. This system facilitates retention of structural features of old-growth forests, such as live and dead trees of varying sizes, multiple canopy layers, and coarse woody debris. Weyerhaeuser’s British Columbia Coastal Group will use the variable retention approach for all harvesting by 2003. More than 75% of the company’s coastal harvesting in British Columbia used variable retention in 2001. Company guidelines describe the amount, type, and spatial distribution of retention for groups and individual trees. An adaptive management program is monitoring the amount and type of structural attributes retained in relation to the original forest.",BC Ministry of Forests,"case study, canada, british columbia, coastal bc, coastal forests, CWH, coastal western hemlock, CDF, coastal douglas fir, harvest, intervention, adaptive management, old growth stand structure, forest health, ecosystem health, timber, economic, variable retention, retention system, Hw, western hemlock, tsuga heterophylla, OGMA , old growth managemetn area, WHA, wildlife habitat area, structure, dwarf mistletoe, root rot",Open Data Commons Attribution License,"variable-retention, stand-interventions"
9,Adapting forest and range management to climate change in the Skeena Region: Considerations for practitioners and Government staff,"There is strong scientific evidence that climate change will significantly affect British Columbia’s forests and rangelands. 1 Therefore, adapting forest and range management to climate change is necessary to foster resilient 2 ecosystems that continue to provide the services, products and benefits society relies on. This extension note is part of a series that uses current climate change research 3 to summarize, for each region, projected climate changes, impacts to ecosystems, and potential adaptation strategies. Where regional information is limited, information is drawn from provincial-scope research. The intent of this extension note is to inform adaptation of forest and range practices to climate change by providing best available information4 to resource professionals, licensees, and Government staff engaged in: operational planning under the Forest and Range Practices Act; monitoring effectiveness of adaptation practices; assessing cumulative effects; and, preparing climate change action plans.

10,Comparing Clearcutting and Alternatives in a High-elevation Forest: Early Results from Sicamous Cree,"The Sicamous Creek Silvicultural Systems project examines clearcutting and silvicultural alternatives to clearcutting in high-elevation Engelmann spruce – subalpine fir (ESSF) forests, motivated by concerns about the effects of forestry practices on regeneration, hydrology, and biological diversity. Treatments include: 1-ha clearcuts, arrays of 0.1-ha openings, arrays of 0.1-ha patch cuts, individual tree selection (ITS), and uncut controls. The replicated experimental treatments at an operational scale have attracted many researchers to the site.We summarize the results of studies that have looked at harvest treatment effects and the effects of different opening sizes on 50 different resource values and ecosystem components, including: harvest economics and the residual stand, microclimate and snow, soil ecology, conifer regeneration, and biodiversity. All harvest treatments were successfully implemented under winter conditions. Harvest cost was somewhat less for 10-ha clearcuts than for the other treatments. Physical conditions for regeneration were generally better with 1- and 10-ha openings, but 0.1-ha openings or individual tree selection harvesting favoured many soil processes, natural regeneration, and components of biological diversity. Across all studies, most variables showed similar responses to the 1-ha openings and the 10-ha openings, but different responses to the 0.1-ha openings or individual tree selection. Openings of 1 ha or more could therefore be considered ecologically similar to larger clearcuts, implying that recent increased use of 3- to 5-ha openings operationally may not represent much ecological change from previous 20- to 40-ha clearcuts. Harvesting with 0.1-ha patch cuts was more often preferred for study variables than harvesting with uniform selection cuts.We recommend more operational trials with small patch cuts or patchy group selection, varying the amount of timber removed and size of gaps, as a way of increasing the ecological diversity of harvesting practices in the ESSF, and to help meet the growing list of objectives for high-elevation forestry.",FORREX,"extension note, canada, british columbia, southern interior bc, shuswap - sicamous, montane and subalpine forests, ESSF, engelmann spruce subalpine fir, harvest, adaptive management, timber, economic, hydrology, ecosystem health, forest health, variable retention, planting, regeneration cut, ESSF_wc_2,  Bl, subalpine fir, abies lasiocarpa, Se, engelmann spruce, picea engelmannii, pine marten, growth, site productivity, structure, bark beetle, windthrow",Open Data Commons Attribution License,variable-retention
